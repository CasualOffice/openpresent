# 22 — The presentation model

## Shape

```
Presentation
├ slide size, defaults, sections, custom shows, core properties
├ Themes        colour scheme, font scheme, format scheme, per master
├ Masters       background, shape tree, text styles (title, body, other), colour map
│  └ Layouts    background, shape tree, placeholder definitions
├ Slides        ordered; layout ref, hidden flag, background, shape tree,
│               transition, timing tree, notes, comments
└ Media and embedded parts: by content hash, decoded lazily
```

A **shape tree** holds these node kinds: `Shape`, `Picture`, `Group`, `Connector`,
`GraphicFrame` (table, chart, SmartArt, OLE), `Media`, `Ink`. Every node has a transform
(offset, extent, rotation, flips), fill, line, effects, and optionally a text body. A
**text body** holds properties and paragraphs; a paragraph holds properties and runs,
breaks, and fields.

Units stay as the file has them, usually EMU and centipoints. Charts and timing carry doubles and coordinates admit units such as `1in`, so source lexemes are kept (`MODEL-01`).

## Inheritance is resolved, never stored

A property value in the model is what the file said, or absent. Effective values come
from `-style`, walking the chain:

```
run → paragraph → shape text body → shape list style
    → matching placeholder on the layout → matching placeholder on the master
    → master text styles → presentation default text style
```

Colours resolve through scheme colour → slide or layout colour-map override → master
colour map → theme, then their transforms (`lumMod`, `tint`, `alpha`, and so on).
Placeholder matching follows PowerPoint's rule by index and type; that rule gets its own
fixtures because an error misplaces a whole slide.

The ribbon reads effective values through the same resolver, so "what the ribbon says the
font is" and "what is drawn" cannot differ. Results are cached per object and invalidated
by the op's changed-object set: a master edit invalidates its layouts and slides.

## Identity

Each object has a stable internal `ObjectId`, independent of the file's `spid`, which is
only unique per slide and which PowerPoint can renumber. `spid` is kept for writing back
and for what timing trees and connectors reference. Slides, layouts and masters have ids
too. Ids are what ops and the wire carry.

## The fidelity contract

Named by dimension. "Lossless" is not used.

| Dimension | Contract | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unedited save | Output bytes equal input bytes | Corpus byte compare |
| Edited save, untouched parts | Each part's bytes unchanged; only touched parts and the bookkeeping parts they require are rewritten | Per-part hash compare |
| Edited part, unknown content | Unmodelled elements, attributes and `extLst` retained in place, including `mc:AlternateContent` choices | Semantic diff on the rewritten part |
| Semantic | Import → export → import yields an equal model | Fixed-point test |
| Rendering | Within per-fixture pixel threshold of reference | Fidelity tool |
| Loss | Whatever cannot be kept is counted and named | Report gate; a silent drop fails CI |

**Bookkeeping parts** deserve care: content types, the presentation relationship list and
`presentation.xml` change when slides are added, and `app.xml` holds counts. Rewriting them
is fine and is documented, so the part-hash gate has an explicit allow-list per edit kind.

## Retained vs. drawn

| Construct | Plan |
| --- | --- |
| SmartArt | Edit (`DGM-01`): render the stored drawing part; layout engine in 2J; data parts retained until then |
| Charts | Model and plot; embedded workbook retained verbatim; edit its data through OpenCalc's SDK |
| Equations (OMML) | Edit (`DGM-01`): math layout in 2K; fallback image retained until then |
| OLE, VBA, ActiveX | Retain; draw the fallback image; never execute |
| Linked media and images | Never fetched automatically; the host decides |
| 3D models, Zoom slides, Morph | Render fallback where one exists; named in the report |

## Limits

Threats and controls are in [07](07-SECURITY-THREAT-MODEL.md).

A presentation admits the package limits from OpenCalc's docs/21, plus per-construct ceilings
in the same contract: shape count per slide, nesting depth of groups, paragraph and run counts,
image pixel count before decode, timing-tree depth, and custom-geometry path count. A hostile
deck must be rejected or truncated with a report entry, never allowed to allocate freely.
Values are set in Phase 0 and asserted by fixtures.
